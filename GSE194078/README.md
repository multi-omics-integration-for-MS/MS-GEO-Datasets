| Summary         | Inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS (IDD) is a heterogeneous group of autoimmune diseases, and multiple sclerosis is the most common type. Dendritic cells (DCs), major antigen-presenting cells, have been proposed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of IDD. The AXL+SIGLEC6+ DC (ASDC) has been only recently identified in humans and has a high capability of T cell activation. Nevertheless, its contribution to CNS autoimmunity remains still obscure. Here, we aimed to identify the ASDC in diverse sample types from IDD patients and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). A detailed analysis of DC subpopulations using single-cell transcriptomics for the paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples of IDD patients (total n = 9) revealed that three subtypes of DCs (ASDCs, ACY3+ DCs, and LAMP3+ DCs) were overrepresented in CSF compared with their paired blood. Among these DCs, ASDCs were also more abundant in CSF of IDD patients than in controls, manifesting poly-adhesional and stimulatory characteristics. In the brain biopsied tissues of IDD patients, obtained at the acute attack of disease, ASDC were also frequently found in close contact with T cells. Lastly, the frequency of ASDC was found to be temporally more abundant in acute attack of disease both in CSF samples of IDD patients and in tissues of EAE, an animal model for CNS autoimmunity. Our analysis suggests that the ASDC might be involved in the pathogenesis of CNS autoimmunity. |
| Overall design  | We have generated a single-cell transcriptome dataset for paired cerebrospinal fluid and PBMC samples from 9 Inflammatory demyelinating disease patients and 2 healthy controls without inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. |
