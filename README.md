# MS-GEO-Datasets: Multiple Sclerosis Datasets from GEO
This repository hosts datasets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) related to multiple sclerosis (MS) research. 


| GEO Accession | Provided Information | Technology Used | Type of Data | Tissue/Cell Type Analyzed | Specific Samples |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| [GSE239626](GSE239626/README.md)     | Gene expression profiling using high-throughput sequencing (scRNA-seq and CITE-seq) | scRNA-seq, CITE-seq | Processed matrix (gene expression) | Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) | Multiple sclerosis patients treated with high-dose vitamin D and placebo |
| [GSE159033](GSE159033/README.md)     | Whole-transcriptome profiling in PBMCs from patients with LS-OCMB characterization reveals 4 RNAs as biomarkers of highly active disease | Non-coding RNA profiling by array, RNA-seq | Processed data (miRNA) | Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) | Multiple sclerosis patients with positive and negative LS-OCMB status |
