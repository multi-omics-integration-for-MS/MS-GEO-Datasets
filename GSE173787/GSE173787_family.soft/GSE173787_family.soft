!Series_summary = How epigenetic changes contribute to MS pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in four immune cell populations isolated from MS patients at clinical disease onset. We also performed parallel transcriptome analysis in B cells to better understand the functional consequences of the DNA methylation changes in MS.
!Series_overall_design = Four immune cell populations, namely CD4+ and CD8+T cells, CD14+ monocytes and CD19+ B cells, were FACS sorted from PBMC samples from a cohort of MS and HC subjects. Cell were then used for DNA extraction and DNA methylation profiling by bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq). The total RNA from B cell fractions were used for mRNA-seq.

For each CpG there are four columns of data including chromosome name, location of the left CpG sits, location of the right CpG site, methylation level.

The methylation level was estimated as NC/(NC + NT) in each CpG site. For each CpG there are four columns of data including chromosome name, location of the left CpG sits, location of the right CpG site, methylation level.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was fragmented, end-repaired, A-tailed, and ligated to methylated adaptors.

!Sample_data_processing = The low quality reads were filtered by Trimmomatic, then the reads were uniquely mapped to the reference genome (hg38, UCSC) using the Bismark software. The bisulfite conversion rates were calculated using the lambda DNA.

!Sample_data_processing = Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Methylation level for each CpG covered by a minimum of 3 reads. We counted the number of 'C' bases from sequencing reads as  methylated (denoted as NC) and the number of 'T' bases as unmodified (denoted as NT). The methylation level was estimated as NC/(NC + NT) in each CpG site. For each CpG there are four columns of data including chromosome name, location of the left CpG sits, location of the right CpG site, methylation level.
