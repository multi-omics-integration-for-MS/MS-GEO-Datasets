| Title             | Whole-transcriptome analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with lipid-specific oligoclonal IgM band characterization reveals two circular RNAs and two linear RNAs as biomarkers of highly active disease |
| Organism          | Homo sapiens                                                                                                   |
| Experiment type   | Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing                                                         |
| Summary           | The study investigates the expression profile of miRNA, snoRNA, circRNA, and linearRNA in PBMCs from MS patients with lipid-specific oligoclonal IgM band characterization. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR reveal two circular (hsa_circ_0000478 and hsa_circ_0116639) and two linear RNAs (IRF5 and MTRNR2L8) as downregulated in PBMCs from patients with positive LS-OCMBs, serving as minimally invasive biomarkers of highly active disease. |
| Overall design   | 4 MS patients with positive and 4 patients with negative LS-OCMB status                                         |
